## Problem Title
E-Waste Facility Locator
## Problem Description
Website that tells you the location of the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facility. Offers educational pop-ups on the harmful components of your e-waste and their effects on the environment and human health if not disposed correctly. There could be an option to input the model of your old device and earn credit points relative to the amount of precious metals recovered from the device if disposed correctly.

Ministry of Environment

## Idea
"EcoE-WasteConnect", an innovative platform utilizing AI-driven algorithms to instantly locate the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facilities. Beyond just directions, it educates users on the environmental and health hazards of improper disposal through interactive modules. What sets it apart is its integration with IoT sensors in recycling facilities, allowing users to input their old device models and receive real-time updates on the precious metals recovered, earning them eco-credits redeemable for discounts on eco-friendly products or donations to environmental causes. This gamified approach not only promotes responsible disposal but also fosters a sustainable mindset among users, turning e-waste management into a rewarding journey for both individuals and the planet.
